To run the coverstore example use the command:
make cover

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This projects has calculator as DUT and UVM Testbench along with functional coverage.

-------- Designed and Coded by Sanket Borhade


The following keypad is used as input to the DUT.
Currently its 4x4 keypad. following is the layout:
	
  	0	1	2	3	
  	4	5	6	7	
  	8	9	+	-	
  	*	/	=	c	
	
This calculator is able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operation.
It also has clear option to clear the contents at any point of time. This calculator has ability
to perform multiple operations before hitting equals(=)(example: 2+3*4/23*45+12=). This feature
also enables to use signed operations indirectly(example: 0-2+1= gives result for -2+1). But
you cannot input negative numbers directly using keypad(example: -2+1  such input from keypad 
performs 2+1 operation).

The maximum result that can be displayed on 4 digit 7 segment display is 9999. There is led to show
negative results and can be viewed as follows:
      _   _   _   _   
    _|_| |_| |_| |_|
     |_| |_| |_| |_|

Every key press displays the corresponding key on the display and after every 2 operands and 2nd 
operator result is displayed. Any operation key has no effect on the display and retains the previous
value.

UVM Testbench: (pictorial view of the setup is in uvmtb_design.pdf)

AluPacket used for transaction:
  int operand1;
  int operand2;
  operation operator1;
  operation operator2;
  int result;
  int result_sign;
  
  operation can be --> add,sub,mul,div,equal,clear

Procedure to run the UVM Testbench:

1. if you just want to run the code and see results use "make cmd"
2. if you want to see results in GUI and want to check result use "make debug"
3. if you want to get coverage report use "Make cover" and then check the HTML report in ./covhtmlreport/index.html
4. if you want to clean the workspace use "make clean"
5. Entering "make" will give you all the options that you can use.

Coverage:

	If you want to know about the exclusions in the coverage, you can look into "exclusions" file for details and
use "make cover" command for running the coverage on the DUT using SystemVerilog testbench.
